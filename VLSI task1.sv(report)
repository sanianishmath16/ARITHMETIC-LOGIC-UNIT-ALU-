1. Objective
To design a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog that supports addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, OR, and NOT operations. Simulation is performed using a testbench to validate functionality.

2. Tools Used
Verilog HDL

Xilinx Vivado / ModelSim (for simulation)

GTKWave (for waveform visualization)

3. ALU Operations
SEL Code	Operation	Description
000	ADD	A + B
001	SUB	A - B
010	AND	A & B
011	OR	A | B
100	NOT	~A (only A is used)

4.Here some output table for simulation and ALU:
| Time | SEL | A    | B    | OUT  | COUT |
| ---- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 0ns  | 000 | 0011 | 0001 | 0100 | 0    |
| 10ns | 001 | 0100 | 0001 | 0011 | 0    |
| 20ns | 010 | 1100 | 1010 | 1000 | 0    |
| 30ns | 011 | 1100 | 1010 | 1110 | 0    |
| 40ns | 100 | 1100 | 0000 | 0011 | 0    |
| 50ns | 111 | ---- | ---- | 0000 | 0    |

5. Conclusion
The designed ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations successfully. All operations were verified using testbench and simulation outputs matched expected results.
